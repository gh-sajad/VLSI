# VLSI Design Course - Fall 2024

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my VLSI Design course project this semester. This repository contains all the coursework, projects, assignments, and relevant materials related to the study and design of Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits and systems.

## Course Overview

The VLSI Design course covers the fundamental principles and techniques used in the design, analysis, and optimization of integrated circuits. Throughout the semester, we focus on topics such as:

- Digital circuit design
- CMOS technology and fabrication processes
- Design methodologies and tools (HDL, CAD, simulation)
- Power, performance, and area trade-offs
- Layout design and verification
- Low-power design techniques

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Assignments/**: Contains individual assignments and solutions covering various topics in VLSI, including MATLAB and testbench codes.
- **/Projects/**: Includes project files, reports, and presentations for the semester-long design project.
- **/Notes/**: Course notes, references, and resources used for studying and understanding VLSI concepts.
- **/Sourses/**: Source book and class slides which is taught in the class.

## Tools and Technologies

The course and projects utilize various software and hardware tools, including:

- **Hardware Description Languages (HDL)**: Verilog, VHDL
- **EDA Tools**: Cadence, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics
- **Simulation and Synthesis**: ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado
- **Layout and Verification**: Magic, KLayout
- **Version Control**: Git for code management and collaboration

## Project Description

The main project for the course involves designing, simulating, and implementing a custom VLSI circuit. It will cover the entire design flow from concept to layout, including:

- **Specification**: Defining the circuit's functionality and requirements
- **Design**: Creating the circuit using HDL and schematic-based techniques
- **Simulation**: Verifying functionality through simulation
- **Synthesis**: Converting the design to a gate-level netlist
- **Layout**: Performing physical design and verification
- **Testing**: Ensuring the design meets the specifications

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository:
